# TensorObserver
TensorObserver is a tensor observer library.

It can display tensors and texts in a window.  
Layout is very simple and good.  
Tensor can be displayed in Intensity mode.

It can support any tensor format, for example: libtorch torch::Tensor.

# Requirements
Windows 7 or later

At present, TensorObserver use native win32 gdi APIs.  
In the future, TensorObserver will switch to QT.  
Then it could run in linux too.

# Building
Open project with Visual Studio 2013 or later.  
Build.
